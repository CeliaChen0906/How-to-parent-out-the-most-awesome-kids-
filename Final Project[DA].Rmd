```{r}
d <- da21600.0001
summary(d$hometime)
library(data.table)
d$hometime <- as.numeric(d$H1WP1)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
