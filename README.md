  This research is focusing on the intimacy and independent dimensions of parenting style’s impact on children’s academic performance and physical health status by analyzing the national longitudinal study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), first wave’s adolescent In-home interview data.

## Introduction
 
   Parenting style is a psychological concept, which represents the strategies that parents use in their child rearing; it is a broad pattern of parenting practices, emphasizing more on the quality of the parenting. 
   
   I chose to use 2 new dimensions on classifying parenting style here: _Intimacy and Independence_. 
   
## Data

   The research used the national longitudinal study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) 1st Wave In-Home Interview Data. 
   
   The survey started in 1994, and followed up with a series of in-home interviews conducted in 1995, 1996, 2001-2002, 2007-2008, five waves have been conducted till now in total. It is one of the biggest and most comprehensive longitudinal surveys of adolescents. 
   The first wave In-Home interview data we used here were collected around 1995 to 1996, including 6,054 observations and over 2,000 variables. The researches’ value hugely grew till the wave 3 till now since now the respondents have grown up. This research can be further continued by analyzing the following-up data on these adolescents.


## Interpretation of Final Model
   
   After applying linear regression model on variables, it shows parent’s education and family annual income, on average,
independence parenting index increased one unit, the health status would move up 0.024 more to the higher category. It is statistical significant at 90% level. 

  Compared to independence parenting index, the intimacy degree has much bigger impact on children’s health status, it is statistical significant at 99% level, and averagely increase the health status by 0.116 higher category every unit increase in the intimacy index, holding age, parents’ education degree and the family income.

## Conclusion

   According to the results from regression models, it’s clear that the two parenting style dimensions have huge impact on adolescences’ health status and academic performance. Compared to the former researches, this researches have a few interesting findings: 
 
 + Letting children make daily decisions on themselves does have a positive and statistical significant influence on their health status, especially their school performance. 
 
   Even though the influence on health status is only significant at 90% level, but since most of factors’ effect on health is more long-term, the health conditions of adolescences have more things to do with genetically influence. In the contrast of other researches claiming that demanding parent hood or strict boundaries with harsh punishment would result in positive effect on school performance, this researches emphasizes respecting children’s independence and encourage them to make decision on their own based on their rational judgment can cultivate the sense of responsibility, self-consciousness, self-disciplined which are all very important in excellent academic performance.

 + Spending more time with your children and promoting positive and effective communication would improve children’s health status. 
  
   This can be explained from 2 perspective: first of all, the intimacy relationship between parents and children also represents that the children have been taken good care of which can help them to stay healthy; second, it’s very important that having a satisfying and secure relationship with parents to children’s mental health which effect their physical health status.
